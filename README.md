# A calculator based on QT

## Steps

- Create a new application project, select Qt Widgets Application, and leave it alone.
- Double-click the .ui file to enter the design page. Build the appropriate calculator home page by dragging
- Once created, right-click on each object, select Change Object Name, and change it to an easily recognizable name
- Right-click on each object (except the text edit object), select Transfer to Slot, enter the .cpp file, and start designing

**main.cpp** does not need special treatment.
